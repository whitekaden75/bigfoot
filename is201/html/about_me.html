          Google Defines me as <br />
          "noun: <br />
          Bigfoot; plural noun: <br />
          Bigfeet. a large, hairy, ape-like creature resembling a yeti, <br />
          supposedly found in northwestern America. <br />
          <br />
          wikipedia says this about me <br />
          "Bigfoot, also commonly referred to as Sasquatch, <br />
          is an ape-like cryptid alleged by cryptozoologists <br />
          and enthusiasts to inhabit the forests of North America."
